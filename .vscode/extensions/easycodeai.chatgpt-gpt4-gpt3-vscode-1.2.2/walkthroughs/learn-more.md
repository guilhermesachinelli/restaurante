### **EasyCode: Copy On Click**

When this is checked, all the code inside a code block returned by EasyCode will be automatically copied to clipboard. 

If you want finer control in terms of what to copy, leave this unchecked. When it’s unchecked, you can manually copy the section you want by selecting the code, and copying it. 

### **EasyCode: Max Tokens**

To have a larger context, set this lower! This is the maximum token for generating output. So the larger it is, the smaller your input (prompt) context will be.
